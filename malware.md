| Virus        | Infects computers and other files by inserting a part of its code into another file. It can't execute independently and needs a host file to attach itself to before "actual" infection. | The malicious code or the part of the code that traverses and infects other files is prepended (first bytes), appended (last bytes),  and cavity (in between bytes or in the padding). Then it only infects specific types of files to lessen the chance of getting caught, making less noticeable, and faster infections.
